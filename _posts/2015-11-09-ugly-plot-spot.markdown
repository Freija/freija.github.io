On the wall in front of my desk at LBNL is the Ugly Plot Spot: it is a place
where anybody can showcase the ugliest plots that come out of her/his
analysis code. Because, even when an intended plot is clearly going to make
Charles Joseph Minard proud, sometimes it just comes out as a wrong, unclear, messy,
monochrome, ugly plot! One of my colleagues has set up a Tumblr blog, where any
plotter can now post the best of the worst: [http://uglyplotspot.tumblr.com/](http://uglyplotspot.tumblr.com/).
It feels good to know you are not alone.
