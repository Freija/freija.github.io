When I was working at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, I started the wall of fame/shame called the Ugly Plot Spot.

It was a place where anybody could showcase the ugliest plots that came out of her/his
analysis code. Because, even when an intended plot is clearly going to be amazing,
sometimes it just comes out as a, well, ugly plot! One of my colleagues has set up a Tumblr blog, where any plotter can now post the best of the worst: [http://uglyplotspot.tumblr.com/](http://uglyplotspot.tumblr.com/).
It feels good to know you are not alone.
